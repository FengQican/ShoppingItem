Things to mention:

SwiftUI

Identifiable: new protocol item for SwiftUI
Means that this class will hold the value of an entity with a stable identity

Structs for views

Combining of HStacks and VStacks in order to build views

Super easy to implement with code. Far fewer lines and bit less hassle than using Storyboards (love .onDelete)

@FetchRequest

More uses of structs than before: Done research and it appears they are simpler and faster than classes
See the benefit now of using it over UIView (not having to deal with every subview and within every class)

SceneDelegate rather than AppDelegate for persistentContainer
ManagedObjectContainer is the same and in SceneDelegate
